Notes for preprocessing FORREST data with FMRIPREP

1. Organize the Forrest dataset format to match BIDS specification.
Instruction to re-align the format:

2. Create singularity image to run the preprocessing on computing cluster. It may cause some problem when using singularity directly.
Instruction to create singularity image:

3. Submit script to SLURM to run preprocessing job automatically in the cluster background.

Sbatch command as follow:
/User/chloe/Documents/fmriprep_sbatch/sbatchrun_FMRIPREP_sub-16_sing.sh

4. If the output log reports error like "could not run node", it might because of random changes on the cluster operation. Submit the job again several times until the error disappear. Be aware to delete 'scratch_singularity' and 'work' directory before submitting the same job again.
