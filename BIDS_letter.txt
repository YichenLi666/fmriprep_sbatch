The original dataset format is as below:
	- sub-01/
		+ anat/
		+ func/
	- sub-02/
		+ anat/
		+ func/
	…

The following modifications are suggested to be made to match the BIDS specification:

1. Add a description file, named dataset_description.json, in the dataset main directory.
See details in the BIDS specification page 14: 
http://bids.neuroimaging.io/bids_spec1.1.0.pdf
The file should contain information such as "BIDSVersion", "License", "Name", "ReferencesAndLinks", etc. Noted that the "ReferencesAndLinks" data should be a list.

2. There are two sessions in each subject's experiment, the localizer session and the movie session. We label the sessions as ses-localizer, and the ses-movie. 
Make separate directories for each session within the subject directory, and within each session’s directory it should contain a func/ directory and an anat/ directory.
Example:
	- sub-01/
		- ses-localizer/
			+ anat/
			+ func/
		- ses-movie/
			+ anat/
			+ func/
	- sub-02/
		- ses-localizer/
			+ anat/
			+ func/
		- ses-movie/
			+ anat/
			+ func/
	...

3. Move the original files inside sub-xx/func/ directory into the corresponding sub-xx/ses-localizer/func/ directory or sub-xx/ses-movie/func/ directory according to the session label in the file name.

4. Make copies of all the original files in the sub-xx/anat/ directory, and move the copies to the sub-xx/ses-localizer/anat/ directory. Then move the original files to the sub-xx/ses-movie/anat/ directory.

5. After moving all files into the corresponding session directories, remove the original sub-xx/anat/ directory and sub-xx/func/ directory (now they should all be empty).

6. Rename the files in sub-xx/ses-localizer/anat/ and in sub-xx/ses-movie/anat/ directories to contain the corresponding session label (which is either ses-localier, or ses-movie).
Example:
	- sub-01/
		- ses-localizer/
			- anat/
				- sub-01_ses-localizer_mod-T1w_defacemask.nii.gz
				- sub-01_ses-localizer_T1w.nii.gz
				- sub-01_ses-localizer_T1w.json
			+ func/
		- ses-movie/
			- anat/
			    - sub-01_ses-movie_mod-T1w_defacemask.nii.gz
			    - sub-01_ses-movie_T1w.nii.gz
			    - sub-01_ses-movie_T1w.json
			+ func/
	+ sub-02/
	...

7. Specifically, for the defacemask file in each sub-xx/ses-localizer/anat/ directory and each sub-xx/ses-movie/anat/ directory, the naming style should be converted to the following:
(Example) sub-01_ses-localizer_mod-T1w_defacemask.nii.gz
The mode (T1w) should be labeled as mod-T1w and should be separated by underscores with the session label (which is ses-localizer in this example) and defacemask label.

8. Add RepetitionTime and TaskName information in each json file from sub-xx/ses-localizer/func/ directory, and from sub-xx/ses-movie/func/ directory.
The RepetitionTime and TaskName should be placed outside the "global" key, and should be saved as two independent keys inside the json file.
The RepetitionTime should be recorded in seconds instead of milliseconds. 
The old RepetitionTime should be renamed or deleted so that it will not influence the new RepetitionTime data.
For the TaskName data, it should match the task label in the file name according to a certain format. See BIDS specification page 23 for detail: 
http://bids.neuroimaging.io/bids_spec1.1.0.pdf
Example of a json file (sub-01_ses-localizer_task-movielocalizer_run-1_bold.json):
{
    "RepetitionTime": 2.0, 
    "TaskName": "task-movielocalizer", 
    "global": {
        "const": {
        ...
        },
        ...
    },
    ...
}

9. Add SliceTiming information in each json file from sub-xx/ses-localizer/func/ directory, and from sub-xx/ses-movie/func/ directory.
